# How FinOpenPOS Works

FinOpenPOS is designed to streamline retail and service business operations by providing an integrated platform for sales, inventory, and customer management. Below is an overview of the system's architecture and workflow.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend:**
  - Built with Next.js and React for fast, interactive UIs.
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.
  - Supports multiple languages via the `messages/` directory.

- **Backend:**
  - Next.js API routes handle business logic and data processing.
  - Supabase provides authentication and database services.
  - Stripe integration for secure payment processing.

- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL schema defined in `schema.sql`.
  - Stores products, orders, users, roles, inventory, and more.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Users sign up or log in via Supabase Auth.
- Role-based access control (admin, cashier, etc.) restricts features.

### 2. Inventory Management
- Products are added, updated, or removed via the admin dashboard.
- Low-stock alerts are generated automatically.
- Restocks and returns update inventory in real time.

### 3. Sales & Checkout
- Cashiers process sales through the POS interface.
- Orders are created and stored in the database.
- Payments are processed via Stripe.
- Receipts and order history are available to users.

### 4. Returns & Refunds
- Returns are initiated from the POS or admin panel.
- Inventory is updated and refunds are processed as needed.

### 5. Employee & Role Management
- Admins can add, edit, or remove employees.
- Roles determine access to features and data.

### 6. Localization
- UI text is managed in `messages/` for easy translation.
- Users can select their preferred language.

## API Endpoints
- RESTful API routes under `pages/api/` for products, orders, customers, etc.
- Webhooks for payment and inventory events.

## Extensibility
- Modular component structure for easy customization.
- API-first design for integration with other systems.

## Security
- All sensitive operations require authentication.
- Data validation and error handling throughout the stack.
