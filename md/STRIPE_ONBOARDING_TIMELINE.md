3. Clicks "Start Stripe Onboarding" button
4. üöÄ STRIPE CONNECT ACCOUNT CREATED
5. Redirected to Stripe onboarding flow
```

## üîÑ **Detailed Stripe Connect Flow**

### **Step 1: User Clicks "Start Stripe Onboarding"**
```typescript
// /admin/settings/stripe/page.tsx (line 49)
const startOnboarding = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/connect', { method: 'POST' });
  const data = await response.json();
  window.location.href = data.url; // ‚Üí Redirect to Stripe
};
```

### **Step 2: Stripe Connect Account Created**
```typescript
// /api/stripe/connect/route.ts (lines 47-58)
const account = await stripeConnect.createAccount({
  email: user.email,           // From user registration
  businessName: company.name,  // From company registration
  type: 'express',            // Simplified onboarding
});

// Save Stripe account ID to database
await supabase.from('companies').update({
  stripe_account_id: account.id,     // ‚Üê "acct_ABC123" 
  stripe_account_type: 'express',
}).eq('id', company.id);
```

### **Step 3: User Completes Stripe Onboarding**
```
üè¶ STRIPE ONBOARDING FORM:
1. Business information verification
2. Bank account details  
3. Tax identification
4. Identity verification
5. Terms acceptance
```

### **Step 4: Onboarding Complete**
```typescript
// User returns to /admin/settings/stripe/complete
// System checks account status:
const account = await stripe.accounts.retrieve(company.stripe_account_id);

// Update company status:
await supabase.from('companies').update({
  stripe_onboarding_complete: true,
  stripe_charges_enabled: account.charges_enabled,
  stripe_payouts_enabled: account.payouts_enabled,
}).eq('id', company.id);
```

## üéØ **When Each Capability Becomes Available**

### **Immediately After Registration:**
```
‚úÖ Dashboard access
‚úÖ Product management  
‚úÖ Inventory tracking
‚úÖ Employee management
‚úÖ Settings configuration
‚ùå Payment processing
‚ùå Checkout functionality
‚ùå Revenue generation
```

### **After Stripe Onboarding Complete:**
```
‚úÖ Everything above, PLUS:
‚úÖ Payment processing
‚úÖ Checkout with credit cards
‚úÖ Revenue generation for platform
‚úÖ Automatic platform fees
‚úÖ Bank transfers to company
‚úÖ Full POS functionality
```

## üìä **Database States During Onboarding**

### **Initial State (After Registration):**
```sql
-- companies table
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Joe's Coffee Shop",
  stripe_account_id: NULL,              -- No Stripe yet
  stripe_onboarding_complete: FALSE,
  stripe_charges_enabled: FALSE,
  platform_fee_percent: 2.5             -- Default fee
}
```

### **After "Start Onboarding" Clicked:**
```sql
-- companies table  
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Joe's Coffee Shop", 
  stripe_account_id: "acct_ABC123",     -- Stripe account created
  stripe_onboarding_complete: FALSE,    -- Still in progress
  stripe_charges_enabled: FALSE,
  platform_fee_percent: 2.5
}
```

### **After Onboarding Complete:**
```sql
-- companies table
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Joe's Coffee Shop",
  stripe_account_id: "acct_ABC123",     -- ‚úÖ Ready
  stripe_onboarding_complete: TRUE,     -- ‚úÖ Complete
  stripe_charges_enabled: TRUE,         -- ‚úÖ Can charge cards
  stripe_payouts_enabled: TRUE,         -- ‚úÖ Can receive money
  platform_fee_percent: 2.5             -- ‚úÖ Revenue flowing
}
```

## üö® **What Happens If They Don't Complete Onboarding?**

### **Stuck in Limbo:**
```
‚ùå Cannot process any payments
‚ùå Checkout buttons don't work
‚ùå No revenue generated (for them or platform)
‚ùå Essentially a demo/inventory system only
‚ö†Ô∏è User sees persistent warnings
```

### **Onboarding Reminders:**
```typescript
// Dashboard shows warnings like:
"‚ö†Ô∏è Payment processing not enabled. Complete Stripe setup to start accepting payments."

// Checkout page shows:
"‚ùå Stripe account not set up. Please complete onboarding first."
```

## üéØ **Platform Revenue Timeline**

### **Revenue Generation Starts:**
```
Day 1: User registers ‚Üí $0 revenue
Day 2-7: User sets up ‚Üí $0 revenue  
Day 8: Stripe onboarding complete ‚Üí üéâ REVENUE STARTS
Day 9: First sale $100 ‚Üí Platform gets $2.50
Day 10: 10 sales @ $50 each ‚Üí Platform gets $12.50
Month 1: Total sales $10,000 ‚Üí Platform gets $250
```

## üìà **Optimizing Onboarding Completion Rate**

### **Current Friction Points:**
1. **User must manually go to Stripe settings**
2. **Onboarding seems optional initially**
3. **No immediate payment pressure**

### **Potential Improvements:**
```typescript
// Force onboarding during first checkout attempt:
if (!company.stripe_charges_enabled) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Complete Stripe setup to process payments',
    redirect: '/admin/settings/stripe' 
  });
}

// Dashboard onboarding progress:
"Setup Progress: 3/4 steps complete - Finish Stripe setup"

// Email reminders:
"Your POS is 90% ready! Complete payment setup to start selling."
```

## üéâ **Summary**

### **When Platform Gets Stripe Info:**
1. **Immediately**: When user clicks "Start Onboarding" 
2. **Account Created**: Stripe Connect account `acct_ABC123` 
3. **Revenue Ready**: When user completes Stripe onboarding
4. **First Revenue**: When they process their first payment

### **Key Insight:**
**The platform gets Stripe account access BEFORE the company can process payments.** This ensures revenue flow is set up correctly from day one!

Your multi-tenant revenue model activates the moment each company completes Stripe onboarding! üöÄüí∞
