const subdomain = companyName
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '-')
  .replace(/-+/g, '-')
  .substring(0, 20);

// Check if subdomain exists, add number if needed
let finalSubdomain = subdomain;
let counter = 1;
while (await subdomainExists(finalSubdomain)) {
  finalSubdomain = `${subdomain}${counter}`;
  counter++;
}
```

#### **Step 5: Stripe Connect Account** ❌ (Need to add)
```typescript
// Create Stripe Connect Express account
const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
  type: 'express',

  capabilities: {
    card_payments: { requested: true },
    transfers: { requested: true },
  },
});

// Save Stripe account ID to company
await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .update({ 
    stripe_account_id: account.id,
    subdomain: finalSubdomain 
  })
  .eq('id', company.id);
```

#### **Step 6: Role & Permissions Setup** ✅ (You have this)
- Creates admin, manager, cashier, employee roles
- Assigns owner as admin
- Sets up full permissions

#### **Step 7: Stripe Onboarding Link** ❌ (Need to add)

  refresh_url: `https://${finalSubdomain}.yourpos.com/settings/payments/refresh`,
  return_url: `https://${finalSubdomain}.yourpos.com/settings/payments/success`,
  type: 'account_onboarding',
});
```

#### **Step 8: Welcome Email** ❌ (Need to add)

- ✅ Isolated database (company_id separation)

### **Pending Setup:**
- ⏳ Stripe Connect onboarding (to accept payments)
- ⏳ Email confirmation
- ⏳ Custom branding (future feature)

## 📋 Ready-to-Use Code Templates

I can help you implement any of these missing pieces. Which would you like to tackle first?

**Most Important Next Steps:**
1. **Subdomain system** - So each company gets their own URL
2. **Stripe Connect** - So they can actually process payments
3. **Enhanced middleware** - To route subdomains correctly

Would you like me to help implement any of these?
