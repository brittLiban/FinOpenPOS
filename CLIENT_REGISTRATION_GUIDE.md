# How to Add New Clients to Your Multi-Tenant POS System

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Your FinOpenPOS system now has a complete client registration system that allows new businesses to sign up and automatically get their own isolated environment.

## ðŸš€ How New Clients Can Register

### 1. **Public Registration Page**
- **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/register`
- **Process**: 
  - Client fills out company information
  - Provides owner details (name, email, password)
  - Enters business contact information
  - System automatically creates their company and account

### 2. **What Happens During Registration**
1. **User Account Creation**: Supabase Auth creates the user account
2. **Company Setup**: Creates company record with unique slug
3. **Profile Creation**: Links user to the company
4. **Role Assignment**: Assigns owner/admin role
5. **Sample Data**: Automatically creates sample products, categories, and settings
6. **Isolation**: All data is automatically scoped to their company

### 3. **Automatic Sample Data Created**
- Sample product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Food, etc.)
- Sample products with realistic pricing
- Payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card)
- Employee roles and permissions
- Basic company settings
