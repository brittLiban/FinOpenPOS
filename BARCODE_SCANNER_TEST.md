# 🔍 Barcode Scanner Test & Verification Guide

## Overview
Your POS system has barcode scanning functionality integrated into multiple pages. This guide will help you test and verify that everything works correctly.

## 🎯 What Should Work

### 1. **Checkout Page** (`/admin/checkout`)
- ✅ Scan barcodes to auto-add products to cart
- ✅ Manual barcode entry works the same as scanning
- ✅ Unknown barcodes prompt to create new products
- ✅ Existing products automatically add to cart
- ✅ Quantity increases for duplicate scans
- ✅ Out-of-stock confirmation dialog

### 2. **Inventory Intake** (`/admin/inventory/intake`)
- ✅ Scan barcodes to find products and update stock
- ✅ Add new products via barcode scanning
- ✅ Manual stock adjustments (+1, +5, +10)
- ✅ Product lookup by barcode

### 3. **Products Management** (`/admin/products`)
- ✅ Add barcodes when creating products
- ✅ Scan barcodes directly into product form
- ✅ Edit existing product barcodes

## 📱 Testing Steps
