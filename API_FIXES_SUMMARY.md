# üîß API Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Found & Fixed:

### 1. **Audit Logging Error (500 Error Source)**
- **Problem**: `logAudit()` was using client-side Supabase in server API route
- **Fix**: Changed to use `createAdminClient()` for server-side operations
- **Impact**: Resolves 500 errors during product creation

### 2. **Improper Error Handling** 
- **Problem**: All errors returned 401 instead of proper HTTP status codes
- **Fix**: Added proper error classification (401 for auth, 500 for server errors)
- **Impact**: Better error reporting and debugging

### 3. **Missing Environment Variable**
- **Problem**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` not defined, causing fetch failures
- **Fix**: Dynamic URL construction using request headers
- **Impact**: Stripe sync calls will work in all environments

### 4. **Audit Logging Robustness**
- **Problem**: Audit failures could break main operations
- **Fix**: Added try-catch with non-throwing error handling
- **Impact**: Product creation won't fail if audit logging has issues

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:

### ‚úÖ **Product Creation (POST /api/products)**
- Should return **200** with product data
- Should log audit trail successfully
- Should handle Stripe sync gracefully

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stripe Sync (POST /api/sync-products)** 
- **400 status is expected** if Stripe Connect not configured
- This is normal behavior for new companies
- Products still get created successfully

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Open your app**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Login** with a valid user account
3. **Go to Products page** and try adding a new product
4. **Expected results**:
   - Product should be created successfully
   - You should see the new product in the list
   - Console should show either sync success or "Stripe Connect not configured"

## If Still Getting Errors:

Check these common issues:
- User not logged in properly
- User missing company association (orphaned user)
- Database connection issues
- Missing environment variables

## Environment Variables to Check:

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Stripe Connect Setup (Optional):

The 400 errors on sync-products are expected until you complete Stripe Connect onboarding:
1. Go to company settings
2. Complete Stripe Connect setup
3. After setup, products will auto-sync to Stripe
